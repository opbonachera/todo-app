# My First Angular App: To-Do Tracker.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.2.5. It is simple but it help me to understand the very fundamentals of Angular. That was the main purpose of the development of this project, so its UI it's not that impressive. 

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.



## Running json server
Run `ng run server` to run the json server.

## Further help
